# Maverik-Capstone-Project

# Summary of business problem and project objective
The Maverik capstone initiative sought to tackle the task of expanding the business reach by around 30 additional stores in the forthcoming year.The key goals were to forecast the daily sales of newly established stores, refine forecast precision for financial planning, and elevate the accuracy of Initial Return on Investment (ROI) computations.

# Group's solution to the business problem
We employ a combination of statistical methods, time-series analysis, and machine learning techniques to create a predictive model. The forecast is centered around predicting sales for the first year of new stores, aiming to understand all the factors influencing variables for sales predictions and to devise new tactics for improving store sales performance.

# Contribution to the project
I contributed to the project by providing ideas and writing code during the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) process. This involved calculating quarterly mean sales for target variables, differentiating total inside sales between weekends and weekdays, and determining average sales during holidays. Additionally, for modeling purposes, I gained a solid understanding of ARIMA and XGB models and wrote code for XGB, using one year's data to predict sales for further analysis.

#  The business value of the solution
The business value of the solution: We provided parking spaces, considered the population around the stores, assessed high-traffic lanes, evaluated fueling positions, and accounted for restroom availability and rewards points.

# Difficulties that your group encountered along the way
Challenges faced included data insufficiency, hindering a thorough analysis. Additionally, modeling codes proved time-consuming and initially failed to run efficiently on the entire dataset. After realizing the approach might be flawed, we adjusted to run the model on a subset of specific weeks' data.

# What you learned in the project
Key learnings from this project include a deep understanding of XGB and ARIMA modeling concepts. I gained insights into innovative approaches for the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) phase. Beyond technical skills, the project taught me valuable lessons about effective teamwork and leadership. Organizing meetings, proposing ideas, and motivating team members are crucial aspects that contribute to the success of a project.
